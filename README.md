# Stock-Prediction-using-News-Headlines
Stock prediction based on news headlines involves analyzing news articles, headlines, and other relevant information to predict the potential impact on stock prices and make investment decisions. Here's a general description of how this process works:

Data Collection: Relevant news headlines, articles, and other financial information are collected from various sources such as news websites, financial publications, social media platforms, and press releases. This data can include company-specific news, industry trends, economic indicators, geopolitical events, and market sentiment.

Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to remove irrelevant information, format the text, and convert it into a suitable format for analysis. This step may involve removing stop words (common words without significant meaning), tokenization (breaking text into individual words or phrases), and applying natural language processing techniques.

Model Training: A predictive model is trained using the historical data and the extracted features. Machine learning algorithms like regression, random forests, support vector machines, or neural networks are commonly used for this purpose. The model learns to associate the features with stock price movements based on the historical data.

Prediction and Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen news headlines. The model analyzes the features of the new headlines and predicts the potential impact on stock prices. The predictions can be evaluated and refined using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error.
